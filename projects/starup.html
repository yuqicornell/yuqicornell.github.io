        <div id="starup-overview">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Overview</h3>
            <p> The project is about redesigning the website for our client: 'StarUp', a startup based in Seattle. As the freelance UX designer, I examined the original website our client had, and redesigned the information architecture with paper prototype and low-fidelity wireframe. With a user-centered design principle, I iterated my design with the client and potential users.</p>

        <div id="starup-ur">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">User Research</h3>
            <p>Before the initial meeting with my client, I reviewed the client’s old website and identified some obvious usability issues: the website begin with a full screen auto-play video, and there are no obvious visual cues as to what the user should do, also it is very distractive. Furthermore, after viewing the whole website, I couldn’t get a good understanding of what this company is doing.</p>
            <p>After an initial meeting with my client, I understood both high-level goals and detailed requirements from my client. One important thing I realized is that my client has a novel business model, and this website has a lot of ‘splainin’ to do, so through my design process, I tried to use a lot of home page space to emphasize what this company is doing. I also tried to involve all sections on the homepage in helping explain or reinforce what this company is about.</p>

            <h4 class="procedure">Persona and Scenrio</h4>
            <p>I created one persona and scenario each based on user research and designed the website flow in responding to each persona’s needs and goals.</p>
            <p><strong>Jeff the tech entrepreneur</strong><br>
                Attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A 27 years old entrepreneur with passion and determination.</li>
                <li>From China, Jeff got his Master’s degree in the U.S. and he has good connections with local Chinese.</li>
                <li>Worked in the tech industry in Seattle for three years.</li>
                <li>No training in business.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Behaviors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Now, he is trying to get his startup to take off.</li> 
                <li>He already has a co-founder and built the prototype of his product, which took his company off the ground. Now he is seeking investors for series A funding opportunities.</li>
                <li>He is also trying to take advantage of growing Chinese investors in the US market.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Goals</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get his startup more publicized</li>
                <li>Attract more investors</li>
                <li>Convey business plan and idea</li>
                <li>Maximize the effect with limited funding they current have</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong><br>
                Jeff was referred by friends to StarUp, and he understood that this is a company that helps to advertise startups. He came to the StarUp website to learn more.</p>
               	<p>He came to the page and confirmed that this is a media company and has something to do with startups. Then he quickly looked at a featured story and confirmed that this company is doing something for startups. He next saw the “how it works” section. With a basic idea of how it works, he scanned through the portfolio section.</p> 
                <p>He now was interested in finding out more about what this company is doing and how this company can help his business. He chose to give this company a call with the information listed.

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Paper Prototype</h3>
            <p>Based on my understanding of the users, I created a paper prototype with different sections needed for the website. I specifically cut each sections, so that I can quickly rearrange different sections for potential workflows. With this paper prototype, I led a discussion with my client to validate my understanding with my client’s needs.

        <div id="starup-wireframing">
            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Wireframing</h3>
            <p>With paper prototype, I created corresponding wireframes. As a self-learning process, I created wireframes using both Axure RP, and Sketch App, which help me see the advantages each tool has. Here are two versions of wireframes:</p>
            <div class="sampleImages">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../img/starup/wireframing_axure.png" alt="Screen capture for a sample artboard" />

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Interactive Axure RP wireframe: <a href="http://e4efpy.axshare.com/home.html">http://e4efpy.axshare.com/home.html</a></p>
            <hr id="btpics"/>
            <div class="sampleImages">
                <figure>
                    <img src="../img/starup/wireframing_sketch.png" alt="Logo design" />
                    <figcaption><em>Fig 5. Wireframing - Sketch</em></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>My favorite feature of Axure RP is how it allows me to quickly test my wireframe in a browser, as well as the ease of sharing it with development team using AxShare. Another excellent feature is the ability to create simple interactions.</p> 
            <p>In contrast, I found Sketch App is more user friendly in interface design, and its wireframe product is more aesthetically pleasing. I especially found it is easy to increase the level of fidelity with Sketch App.</p>

            <h3 class="sectionTitle">Moving Forward</h3>
            <p>With finished prototypes, solutionresources.com’s oversea development team is currently developing the website. I look forward to gathering more feedback from actual users and iterating my designs further.</p>
