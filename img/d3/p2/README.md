##INFO/CS 3300 Project 2: Dynamic Data Visualization##
###General Notes from Meeting 1 (April 12, 2015)###
We will be working on the [Friends in High Places](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/friends-high-places/) challenge, and our visualization will be to map the location of the ISS with respect to the world over time (the user is able to select times using a slider and see its orbit over that time period). We will also show the interaction of one of the astronauts on board, [Samantha Cristoforetti](http://samanthacristoforetti.esa.int/), with her followers on earth via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstroSamantha). We will be using the Twitter api to pull her tweets for a given time and location above the earth as we trace her path over the earth in the ISS.

Datasets: [Orbit of ISS around planet earth](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pg9c9zqw1g32cum/friends-in-space-data.zip?dl=0) and [Samantha's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AstroSamantha).

Division of Labor:
Brendan will handle user input and the sliders,
Yu will handle updating the Earth map with a projection of the ISS
Vesha will handle pulling Samantha's tweets via the Twitter API and updating the map.
